# Portfolio
This repository is for showcasing my portfolio.
I am an Army veteran and emerging cybersecurity professional with a strong track record of coaching, problem-solving, and mission-focused execution. I'm passionate about helping others build cyber skills and equally driven to grow within the field myself. My experience includes managing sensitive information, supporting fast-paced and continuously evolving environments, and maintaining strict compliance with security protocols and deadlines. 

I'm known for quickly mastering new technologies, adapting under pressure, and efficiently managing multiple priorities without sacrificing quality or accuracy. With a foundation in leadership, disciplined work ethic, and a commitment to continuous learning, I'm seeking an entry-level cybersecurity role where I can contribute to a team, strengthen organizational security, and continue developing as a cybersecurity professional.
